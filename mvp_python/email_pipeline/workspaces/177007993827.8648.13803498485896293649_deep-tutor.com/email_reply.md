Hi there,

Thanks for sending the test files. I was able to open both attachments successfully:
- sample.pdf: contains the text "IceBrew PDF attachment".
- sample.docx: contains the text "IceBrew DOCX attachment".

Would you like me to extract these into another format, combine them, or run any other checks?

Best,
IceBrew
