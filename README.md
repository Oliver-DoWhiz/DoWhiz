# DoWhiz

Email-first digital employees that turn inbound messages into structured work
and deliver results back in the same channel.

## Overview
DoWhiz lets users send tasks to role-based agents over email. The platform
routes, schedules, executes, and replies with results, follow-ups, and
scheduled work.

## Core capabilities
- Email-first task intake and replies.
- Role-based agents with isolated, user-specific memory and data.
- Scheduling and orchestration for long-running or recurring work.
- Tool-backed execution for reliable outputs.

## High-level architecture
```
Inbound email -> Scheduler -> Task runner -> Tools -> Outbound email
```

## Vision
The long-term product direction lives in `vision.md`: a multi-agent,
multi-tenant platform where each user has isolated memory/data, agents act
like teammates, and the system escalates when human input is needed.

## Repository layout
