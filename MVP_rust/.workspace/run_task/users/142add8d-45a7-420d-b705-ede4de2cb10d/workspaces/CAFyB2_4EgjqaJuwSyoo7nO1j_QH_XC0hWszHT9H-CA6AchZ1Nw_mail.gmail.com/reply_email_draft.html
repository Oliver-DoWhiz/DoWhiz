    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>
      This looks like a promotional newsletter from the Google Workspace Team about using
      Gmail/Meet/Drive/Calendar on mobile. It was sent from
      <strong>workspace-noreply@google.com</strong> and includes app download links.

      If you didn't mean to receive these, you can use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the
      message. I can also help set up a filter or unsubscribe on your behalf, just let me know.
    </p>
    <p>Best,<br />Oliver</p>
