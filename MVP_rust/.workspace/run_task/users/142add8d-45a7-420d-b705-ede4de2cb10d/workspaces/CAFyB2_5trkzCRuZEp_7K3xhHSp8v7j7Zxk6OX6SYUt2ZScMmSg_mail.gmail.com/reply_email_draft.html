  <p>Hi Mini,</p>
  <p>Here is a concise summary of our prior email thread:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You forwarded a Google Workspace promo email and asked what it was about (a marketing update about using Gmail, Meet, Drive, and Calendar on mobile).</li>
    <li>You asked me to find 5 arXiv papers from today.</li>
    <li>You shared a PDF attachment (<em>Skills_Bench_Benchmark.pdf</em>) and asked for a summary plus a markdown conversion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want me to proceed on any of these, just tell me which one to start with.</p>
  <p>Best,<br>Oliver</p>
