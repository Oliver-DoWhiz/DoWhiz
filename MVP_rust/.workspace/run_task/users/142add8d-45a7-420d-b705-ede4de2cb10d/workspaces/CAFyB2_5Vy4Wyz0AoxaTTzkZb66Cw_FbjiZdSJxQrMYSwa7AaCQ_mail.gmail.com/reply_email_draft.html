    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>Here is a concise summary of the paper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduces SkillsBench, a benchmark for evaluating Agent Skills as structured packages of procedural knowledge and resources that augment LLM agents without model changes.</li>
      <li>Defines Skills and task structure (instruction, environment, solution, verifier), with deterministic verification, leakage audits, and containerized environments for reproducibility.</li>
      <li>Runs large-scale evaluation across 7 agent-model configurations and 6,970 trajectories, comparing performance with and without Skills.</li>
      <li>Finds Skills generally improve pass rates (mean gain around the low-teens in percentage points, with some configurations near +20 pp), but effects are variable; 24 tasks show negative impact and software engineering performance drops by about 5 pp in aggregate.</li>
      <li>Reports design insights: a small number of compact, high-quality Skills works best, while aggressive Skill-aware harnesses can reduce reliability; low-quality Skills can hurt performance by wasting context.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I converted the paper to Markdown and attached it as <strong>SkillsBench_Benchmark.md</strong>. The conversion is text-first, so figures and tables are flattened into text.</p>
    <p>Best,<br>Oliver</p>
