    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>
      Happy to help. Could you share the topic area you want (for example, cs.LG, stat.ML,
      physics, etc.) and how you define “today” (your timezone or UTC)? Also, do you want
      just titles + links, or short 1–2 sentence summaries for each?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I have that, I can pick five fresh arXiv papers and send them over.
    </p>
    <p>Best,<br />Oliver</p>
