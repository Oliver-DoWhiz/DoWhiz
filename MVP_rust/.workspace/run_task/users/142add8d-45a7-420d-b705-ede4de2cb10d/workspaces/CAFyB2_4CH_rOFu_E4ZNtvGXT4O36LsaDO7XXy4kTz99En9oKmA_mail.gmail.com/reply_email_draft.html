    <p>Hi Mini,</p>
    <p>
      From the records I have in this workspace, you've sent 4 emails to us before this
      one. Including today's message, that makes 5.
    </p>
    <p>If you want a specific date range or a different account, tell me and I'll double-check.</p>
    <p>Best,<br />Oliver</p>
