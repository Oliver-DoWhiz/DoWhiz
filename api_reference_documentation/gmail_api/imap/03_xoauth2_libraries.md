# OAuth 2.0 Libraries and Samples for Gmail

## Overview

This documentation page provides developers with libraries and sample code to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization for accessing Gmail's IMAP and SMTP services.

## Java Sample

JavaMail version 1.5.2 and later includes native OAuth support for IMAP. For those using earlier versions or requiring custom implementations, Google offers sample code available through their GitHub repository.

**Resources:**
- Repository: "Tools and sample code for authenticating to Gmail with OAuth2" on GitHub
- Link: github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools
- Reference documentation available via JavaMail's official OAuth2 documentation

## Python Sample

Google provides a Python-based OAuth2 implementation for Gmail authentication.

**Resources:**
- Getting Started Guide: Available on the gmail-oauth2-tools wiki
- Sample Download: oauth2.py file accessible from the Gmail OAuth2 tools repository
- Direct link to raw file provided for quick access

## PHP Sample

PHP developers can access sample code demonstrating OAuth2 authentication with Gmail.

**Resources:**
- Getting Started Guide: PhpSampleCode documentation on the project wiki
- Download: oauth2.php file from the main Gmail OAuth2 tools repository

## Additional Information

The page indicates these samples enable developers to quickly implement OAuth 2.0 authorization rather than building authentication mechanisms from scratch. All code is provided under the Apache 2.0 License.
