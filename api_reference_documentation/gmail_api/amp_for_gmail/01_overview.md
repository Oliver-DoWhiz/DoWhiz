# AMP for Gmail Documentation

## Overview

AMP for Gmail enables developers to create dynamic, interactive email experiences within Gmail. This technology incorporates Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) components directly into email messages, allowing recipients to engage with content without leaving their inbox.

## Key Features

**Dynamic Email Functionality**: AMP for Email provides a subset of AMPHTML components for use in email messages, that allows recipients of AMP emails to interact dynamically with content directly in the message.

## Implementation Requirements

To deploy AMP emails in Gmail, developers must complete three essential steps:

1. **Build AMP-Enabled Emails**: Construct emails incorporating AMP components following the AMP developer documentation. Authentication handling for requests is critical during this phase.

2. **Testing Phase**: Validate emails to confirm proper appearance and expected behavior before production deployment.

3. **Registration & Deployment**: Register with Google before sending dynamic emails to recipients at scale.
