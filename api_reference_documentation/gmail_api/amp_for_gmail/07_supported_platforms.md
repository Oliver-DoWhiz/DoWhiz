# Supported Platforms for Gmail AMP

## Desktop Browser Compatibility

Gmail's AMP functionality depends on modern browser capabilities. On unsupported browsers, emails revert to standard HTML rendering.

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|-----------------|
| Chrome | 69 |
| Edge | Not supported |
| Firefox | 58 |
| Internet Explorer | Not supported |
| Opera | 48 |
| Safari | 10 |

## Mobile Support

Dynamic email features work with the official Gmail applications on both iOS and Android platforms.

**iOS Requirements:**
- Official Gmail app for iOS

**Android Requirements:**
- Official Gmail app for Android
- Minimum OS version: 5.0 (Android Lollipop)
- System WebView version 74 or higher

## Key Takeaway

Gmail's AMP rendering relies on modern browser features which are not supported by all web browsers. On incompatible browsers, emails fallback to HTML. The platform prioritizes user experience across devices by automatically degrading gracefully when necessary.
