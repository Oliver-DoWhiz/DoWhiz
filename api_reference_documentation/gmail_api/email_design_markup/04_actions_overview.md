# What Are Actions? - Gmail Documentation

## Overview

Actions enable users to interact with your product or service right inside Gmail. For example, senders can offer subscription renewal options directly within notification emails, allowing recipients to take action without leaving their inbox.

## Action Types

Actions can be implemented in two primary categories:

### In-App Actions

These are processed directly within Gmail, without redirecting users elsewhere.

**One-Click Actions**

One-click actions handle straightforward confirmation requests. Common scenarios include:
- Email confirmation for account registration
- Queue additions on recommendation platforms

These actions present a button that users can click to confirm a predefined request without additional steps.

### Go-To Actions

Go-To Actions can be used to provide a direct link to the page where the action can be performed. They redirect users to an external site for more complex interactions.

Appropriate use cases include:
- Multi-step processes requiring significant data entry
- Actions that cannot be completed within an inbox interface

Example: An airline check-in reminder can include a Go-To Action directing users to their website to select seats or request upgrades.

## Next Steps

For implementation guidance, refer to the "Declaring Actions" documentation section.

## Technical Note

Some of the schemas used by Google are still going through the standardization process of schema.org, and therefore, may change in the future.
