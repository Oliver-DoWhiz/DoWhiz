# Gmail Email Markup Overview

## Introduction

Email serves as a critical communication tool for personal and professional tasks. By incorporating schema.org markup into emails, senders can make information accessible across Google's ecosystem and enable users to perform quick actions—such as flight check-ins.

Schema.org is a markup vocabulary that is standardized and managed as a collaboration of Google and other companies.

## Key Capabilities

### Gmail Actions

Gmail leverages schema.org markup to expedite user interactions and surface critical information. Supported action types include:

- **One-click Action**: Enables single-click task completion
- **Go-to Action**: Facilitates more involved interactions
- **Flight interactive cards**: Specialized interactive elements for flight information

### Gmail Highlights

The same markup vocabulary enables Gmail to emphasize key details and facilitate user engagement with:

- Bus, car rental, and flight reservations
- Event reservations (with tickets)
- Shopping-related items (orders and parcel delivery)
- Hotel and restaurant reservations
- Train reservations
- Invoices

### Promotions Tab Features

The Promotions tab surfaces valuable email content through:

- Machine learning-driven prioritization
- Deal bundling and organization
- Image previews highlighting message content
- Deal badges indicating expiration and value

## Integration with Google Services

### Google Calendar Integration

With 'Events from Gmail,' Google Calendar extracts events from booking confirmation emails and adds them automatically.

Supported markup types include flight reservations, ticketed events, hotel reservations, and restaurant bookings.

## Standardization Note

Some Google-used schemas remain under schema.org standardization and may evolve.
