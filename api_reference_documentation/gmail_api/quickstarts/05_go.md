# Go Quickstart for Gmail API

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to create a Go command-line application that interfaces with the Gmail API. The approach prioritizes simplicity for testing environments rather than production deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Latest version of Go
- Latest version of Git
- A Google Cloud project
- A Google account with Gmail enabled

## Environment Setup

### Enable the Gmail API

Navigate to the Google Cloud console and activate the Gmail API through the enablement flow.

### Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Access the Google Cloud console's Auth platform branding section
2. Enter your app name under App Information
3. Specify a user support email address
4. Set audience type to "Internal"
5. Provide contact information for notifications
6. Accept the Google API Services User Data Policy
7. Complete the configuration process

### Create Desktop Application Credentials

1. Go to the Google Cloud console's Clients section
2. Create a new client of type "Desktop app"
3. Name your credential (console-only)
4. Save the downloaded JSON file as `credentials.json` in your working directory

## Workspace Preparation

```bash
mkdir quickstart
cd quickstart
go mod init quickstart
go get google.golang.org/api/gmail/v1
go get golang.org/x/oauth2/google
```

## Sample Implementation

Create `quickstart.go` with the following structure:

The sample code handles token management, OAuth flow, and Gmail API interaction. Key components include:

- **getClient()**: Manages token retrieval and client creation
- **getTokenFromWeb()**: Handles authorization code exchange
- **tokenFromFile()**: Loads cached authentication tokens
- **saveToken()**: Persists tokens locally
- **main()**: Initializes the Gmail service and lists user labels

The code uses `gmail.GmailReadonlyScope` for read-only access to Gmail data.

## Execution

```bash
go run quickstart.go
```

On first run, the application prompts for authorization. Users must sign in to their Google Account and grant permissions. Subsequent runs use cached credentials from the token file.

## Next Steps

- Explore the Gmail API through the APIs explorer
- Review troubleshooting guides for authentication issues
- Consult the complete API reference documentation
- Examine additional samples on GitHub
