# Gmail Promotions Tab Developer Guide

## Overview

This page introduces Google's email promotions feature for Gmail, designed to help senders deliver more engaging content in the Promotions tab.

## Key Features

### Automatic Highlighting

Gmail automatically groups and highlights emails in the Promotions tab that people are most likely to engage with.

### Rich Image Annotations

Developers can incorporate visual storytelling through single or multiple product images, creating immersive experiences that encourage user discovery.

### Deal Annotation

A promotional badge appears directly adjacent to subject lines, highlighting discount codes and offer details within the inbox view.

Enable Gmail to automatically generate a visually distinct Deal Card based on the information you provide. These cards consolidate offer details, codes, and landing pages into an action-focused format.

## Notable Adopters

The platform reports usage by major brands including Pinterest, Domino's, Redbox, Sephora, Shutterfly, JustFab, Pandora, Urban Outfitters, Samsung, Kate Spade, and others.

## Important Notes
