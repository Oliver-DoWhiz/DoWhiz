# Best Practices for Email Annotations in Gmail

## Overview

Email annotations enable senders to incorporate images, promotional offers, expiration dates, and other engagement elements to enhance emails within the Gmail Promotions tab.

## Images

**Key Guidelines:**
- Avoid text only. This space was designed to highlight the visual components of promotional content
- Center-cropping is automatic; supported aspect ratios include 4:5, 1:1, and 1.91:1
- Reusing identical images across messages may cause Gmail users to dismiss them as duplicates
- Image URLs must use HTTPS protocol rather than HTTP

## Deal Badge

This element highlights promotion specifics like discount percentages or shipping offers.

**Recommendations:**
- Be specific. Identify the details of your promotion, such as the discount percentage or promo code
- Keep text concise—Avoid using more than 4 words or full sentences in deal badge, as the badge space competes with your subject line

## Logo URL

Use HTTPS URLs only. This logo appears in email previews.

## Discount Code

Only include actual discount codes featured in your email message. The system automatically prepends "Code" before this text.

## Expiration Date

- Using this feature allows an email two opportunities to preview at the top in a bundle: once when it is first sent and again within 3 days of the offer expiring
- Never retain expired dates; they signal outdated offers and prevent bundle inclusion
- Specify complete timestamp and timezone (example: `2018-12-30T23:59:59-0700`)
