# Gmail Email Promotions FAQ

This page addresses common questions from email marketers and developers about Gmail's promotional email features, including bundling and rich previews.

## Cost & Accessibility

**Q: Is there any cost associated with these new features?**

No, email messages in bundles and rich previews are for organic email and therefore it is free. The only paid visibility option in consumer Gmail remains Gmail Ads, while Google Workspace Gmail operates ad-free.

## Tab Classification & Display

**Q: Does adding the annotation affect which tab my email goes into?**

The annotation has no impact on Gmail's tab classification system.

**Q: What if I annotate an email that lands outside the Promotions tab?**

The feature only displays in the Promotions tab, so annotations won't be visible in other tabs.

## Feature Requirements

**Q: Must emails contain all available features?**

No. All features are optional. The documentation recommends using at least logo and image features for better visibility.

**Q: Can I customize the Deal Badge color?**

No, the Deal Badge is green and the color cannot be changed. Badge styling is standardized for consistent user experience.

## Email Types & Personalization

**Q: Is this feature limited to discount-based emails?**

No, all marketing emails qualify for annotation. Features can be mixed freely—product promotions without discounts are eligible.

**Q: Can I use dynamic scripts to populate features?**

Yes, the features/fields are designed to be populated the same way as the body of the email.

## Bundling & Metrics

**Q: Why does my email appear bundled if I haven't added annotations?**

Your email can still appear in a bundle without the annotation. Gmail will recommend emails based on previous user engagement.

**Q: Do unbundled emails have worse performance?**

No, unbundled emails maintain the same metrics as before bundling was introduced.

## Sensitive Content

Google may restrict enriched previews for emails classified under sensitive interest categories, including adult content and debt collection materials, to protect user experience.
