# Using Zoom APIs

Zoom APIs enable developers to request information from Zoom, including (but not limited) to user details, meeting reports, dashboard data, as well as perform actions on the Zoom developer platform on a user's behalf. For example, you can create a new user or delete a user's meeting recordings.

***Note: In this document, you may see the terms client and app used interchangeably. Both of these terms refer to an app using the Zoom API.***

Zoom **must** authenticate each HTTP request made to the Zoom API. Zoom supports **OAuth 2.0**.

## Using OAuth 2.0

Zoom uses [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for authentication. This lets applications obtain access to Zoom resources, such as a user's profile information, using the Zoom API.

The following sections provide an overview on the OAuth protocol. To begin using the OAuth protocol for your app's authentication with Zoom, follow the steps in [OAuth 2.0 for Zoom](/docs/integrations/oauth/).

### OAuth roles

The OAuth protocol defines four specific roles. These roles are actively involved in the process of authentication with Zoom APIs:

- **Resource Owner** - A user in a Zoom account who can either authorize or decline a **Client** from accessing information related to the user's Zoom account.
- **Resource Server** - The server that hosts the resource. If your app is integrating with the Zoom API to obtain user-related information, then the Zoom API server is considered the resource server.
- **Client** - The application that requests access to the user's information. If your app makes access requests to the Zoom API, then your app is considered the Client.
- **Zoom Authorization Server** - The authorization server issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating and obtaining authorization from the resource owner.

### What is an access token?

An **access token** is a credential in the form of a string that represents the authorization granted to the app. For example, like an ID card that identifies a person's level of authority or a driver's license that gives a person permission to drive.

### User-authenticated

Generally, the interaction between a **Client** (your app), a Zoom user, Zoom's authorization server, and the Zoom API follows the flow in the following diagram. This is called the user-authenticated flow as the user has to give access permission to the app.

<Image src="/img/1570826762485.png" alt="The Zoom authorization process" />

1. The **Client** (your app) requests authorization from the Zoom user to access the user's information.
2. The user authorizes the app and the app receives an **Authorization Grant**.
3. The app presents the **Authorization Grant** to the **Zoom Authorization Server** to verify that it has received the user's permission to access user information.
4. The **Zoom Authorization Server** acknowledges that user has permitted the app with requested access and it sends an **Access Token** along with a **Refresh Token** back to the app. The access token must be used as a means of authentication while making API calls to the Zoom API Server.
5. The app calls the Zoom API to access requested resource by including the **Access Token** in the request as a means of authentication. When an access token expires, it becomes invalid. In this case, the client must use the **Refresh Token** to request another valid access token.
6. After the Zoom API server authenticates the app, it sends back the **Requested Resource** in the form of a JSON response. If the authentication fails, an error is thrown stating what caused the error.

### Server-to-Server authentication

Server-to-server authentication does not require the end user to give permission to the app to access their information. The following diagram shows this flow.

<Image src="/img/s2s-auth-flow.png" alt="The Zoom Server-to-Server authorization flow" />

The [Server-to-Server OAuth app type](/docs/internal-apps/) skips the end user authorization step as well as the redirect URL and refresh token.

### OAuth grant types

An **Authorization Grant** is the authorization assigned to the **Client** by the resource owner. The **grant type** refers to the method the Client uses to request authorization.

Zoom supports the standard `authorization_code`, `device_code`, and `refresh_token` [grant types](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use). See [OAuth 2.0 for Zoom](/docs/integrations/oauth/) for details.

Zoom also created the `account_credentials` grant type for server-to-server OAuth app types. See [Internal apps (server-to-server) - Use account credentials to get an access token](/docs/internal-apps/#use-account-credentials-to-get-an-access-token) to learn more.

#### Authorization Code

The following steps provide an overview of the **Authorization Code** grant flow:

1. The **Client** directs the user to the Zoom authorization server. The user will see a dialog box with permission request for access. This process is provisioned by Zoom via the **Authorization URL**. When a user tries to add your app, the user is directed to the Zoom API authorization endpoint. To test it with your app locally, copy the **Testable URL** of your app and open it in a browser. A page similar to the one shown in the image below appears:

<Image
  src="/img/1570827314139.png"
  alt="An example of the permission request dialog box."
/>

2. The user clicks **Authorize**.
3. The user is redirected to the app's `redirect_url` along with an Authorization Code in the query string. The URL with the Authorization Code resembles following URL: `https://yourappsredirecturl/?code={theauthorizationcode}`
4. The **Client** makes a request to Zoom to exchange the Authorization Code for an **access token**.

**Example Node.js request access token with Authorization Code**

```javascript
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  method: 'POST',
  url: 'https://zoom.us/oauth/token',
  qs: {
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    //The code below is a sample Authorization Code. Replace it with your actual Authorization Code while making requests.
    code: 'B1234558uQ',
    //The uri below is a sample redirect_uri. Replace it with your actual redirect_uri while making requests.
    redirect_uri: 'https://abcd.example.com',
  },
  headers: {
    /**The credential below is a sample base64 encoded credential. Replace it with "Authorization: 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(your_app_client_id + ':' + your_app_client_secret).toString('base64')"
     **/
    Authorization: 'Basic abcdsdkjfesjfg',
  },
};

request(options, function (error, response, body) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);

  console.log(body);
});
```

## Using JWT

A JSON Web Token (JWT) lets you to create tokens that provide secure data transmission using a compact JSON object. JWTs contain a signed payload that helps establish server-to-server authentication. See [JWT.io](http://jwt.io) to learn more.

## API requests

<Alert>

**Global base API URL: `https://api.zoom.us/v2/`**

</Alert>

All API requests **must** be made over HTTPS. The `https://api.zoom.us/v2/` URL is the default request base URL. This includes the API version, `/v2`, in the path.

The complete API request URL varies depending on the accessed resource. For example, to [get a user's details](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/GET/users/{userId}) in your app, you **must** make an `GET` request to the [**Get a user**](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/GET/users/{userId}) API at the `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/{userId}` URL, where `{userId}` is the user's ID or email address. If your app is registered in the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us/) as an account-level **OAuth app**, your app **must** have the `user:read:admin` scope in order to use this API.

### Regional base URLs

The `api_url` in the access token response indicates the region serving that user so you can directly send API requests to that region. Currently we expose the following regions.

Region Name | Region | API URL
---         | ---    | ---
Australia | AU | `https://api-au.zoom.us`
Canada | CA | `https://api-ca.zoom.us`
European Union | EU | `https://api-eu.zoom.us`
India | IN | `https://api-in.zoom.us`
Saudi Arabia | SA | `https://api-sa.zoom.us`
Singapore | SG | `https://api-sg.zoom.us`
UK | UK | `https://api-uk.zoom.us`
US | US | `https://api-us.zoom.us`
Vanity account  | N/A | `https://{vanity}.zoom.us`

You can use the `api_url` to create a regional base URL to send requests. Be sure to also include the version in the path, for example `/v2/`.

For example, you can use the base URL `https://api-eu.zoom.us/v2/` to send API requests directly to the EU region if it was returned in the `api_url` field. However, regardless of the `api_url` value, you can continue to use the global region at `https://api.zoom.us` all requests.

***The global API URL is the default: `https://api.zoom.us`.***

### Example API requests

**Example Node.js API request with the user ID for Account-level apps**

```javascript
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  method: 'GET',
  // A non-existing sample userId is used in the example below.
  url: 'https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/sjkf1234',
  headers: {
    authorization: 'Bearer {yourtokenhere}', // Do not publish or share your token publicly.
  },
};

request(options, function (error, response, body) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);

  console.log(body);
});
```

**Example Node.js API request with the user ID for User-level apps**

```javascript
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  method: 'GET',
  // Use the `me` keyword for the request below.
  url: 'https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me',
  headers: {
    authorization: 'Bearer {yourtokenhere}', // Do not publish or share your token with anyone.
  },
};

request(options, function (error, response, body) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);

  console.log(body);
});
```

### Requests for JWT apps

You do not need scopes for [JWT apps](/docs/internal-apps/jwt/). Your JWT app will only have access to **your** Zoom account's information. To view a specific user's information, you **must** provide the user's `userId` or email address as the `{userId}` value in the API path. You can also use [the `me` keyword](the-me-keyword) instead of the `userId` value.

### Requests for OAuth apps

To get information about a user with a user-level OAuth app, the app **must** have the `user:read` scope. While the URL for the request is the same, the behavior of `userId` value is different from an account-level apps. Instead of providing a user's `userId` or email address, you **must** use [the `me` keyword](#the-me-keyword) as the value of the `userId` path parameter. Otherwise, your app will receive an invalid token error.

### Requests for Server-to-Server OAuth apps

Server-to-Server OAuth apps also use scopes. You wouldn't use the `me` keyword with this app type; you must provide a `userId` or email address. See [Server-to-Server authentication](#server-to-server-authentication) for details.

## The me keyword

You can use the `me` keyword in place of the `userId` and the `accountId` keyword in any supported API call. When you use the `me` keyword, the API call uses the authenticated user's access token.

For example, to use the API to [update a user's settings](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/PATCH/users/{userId}/settings) as the authenticated user, you would call the API with the `/users/me/settings` path, not the `/users/{userId}/settings` path.

## Shared access permissions

Some users may have permissions to access (create, read, update, or delete) information associated with other users on Zoom accounts. For example, the [Schedule Privilege](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362803-Scheduling-privilege) enables users to assign other users on their account to schedule meetings on their behalf. A user that has been granted this privilege has access to schedule meetings for the other user. A user may also have a [role](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001078646) that grants them access to other user information.

With shared access permissions, a user can choose whether your app can access the following information:

1. Only information associated with them as the user that added the app (including others involved in that information, for example, a calendar invitation), **or**
2. Both the information associated with them and the others that user is allowed to access (again, along with the others included in that information, such as a calendar invitation).

Item 2 refers to when a user authorizes your app to use their "shared access permissions" after they add or manage your app on their account. In the example above, the user can choose to share access permissions to schedule meetings for another user's account with your app. See [Allowing Apps access to shared access permissions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4413265586189) for details on the end user experience.

### Handling errors for shared access permissions

Your app does not need to do anything different for this access. Zoom handles this via the [Authorization server](/docs/api/using-zoom-apis#oauth-roles).

The users that added your app can continue using your app to access their associated information without the need to take any action. If your app does not access or change information associated with a user other than the user who added it, then you should not receive additional errors.

Your app will receive an error **if your app attempts to access or change information for a user other than the one who added the app** and when the user who added the app:

- Is not authorized to access or change the other user's information, or
- Has not authorized your app to use shared access permissions.

In this case, your app will receive a 403 response with an "authenticated user has not permitted access to the targeted resource" error. This will occur after a request to any API, such as:

- `/v2/meetings/{meetingId}/**`
- `/v2/users/{userId}/**`
- `/v2/webinars/{webinarId}/**`
- `/v2/**/recordings/`
- `/v2/phone/**` (user-level)

Currently, there is no way for your app to know whether a user has authorized shared access permissions for your app. You may be able to determine whether a user should have shared permissions based on the context. For example, your app lets users schedule meetings. In this case, when your app receives the error, you can point the user to the [Allowing Apps access to shared access permissions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4413265586189) Zoom Help Center article that describes how the user can authorize shared permissions for the app.

Once the user authorizes your app with shared permissions, the API will return the expected response.

## Apps with high API failure rates

If any single app has a high error-to-request ratio, Zoom may disable your app. Your apps must handle requests and errors gracefully. If your app was disabled because of a high failure rate or high error-to-request ratio, contact [Support](https://support.zoom.us/) or reach out on the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.zoom.us) for help.

## Email address display rules

Zoom displays email addresses for users external to your account only if they meet any of the conditions below:

* **If the participant entered their email address** into the meeting or webinar registration flow, then it will be shown for that specific meeting or webinar.
* **If the host provided the participant's email to Zoom** in the following ways:
  - If the participant is on the calendar invitation or event using one of Zoom's calendar integrations (Outlook or Google Calendar).
  - If the participant has externally authenticated using an authentication system provided by the host.
  - If the participant email was entered with the "[Allow authentication exception](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360037117472#h_01F13A9N1FQFNVESC9C21NRHXY)" option under "Only authenticated users can join..."
  - If the participant's email was entered using the Breakout Rooms assignment feature or "Allow authentication exception" to Breakout Rooms feature.
  - If you import a CSV file for panelists and attendees of a webinar.

For more information, read the ["Zoom API email address display rules" Changelog post](/changelog/platform/zoom-api-email-address-display-rules).

## Understanding Personal Meeting ID (PMI)

You can start instant meetings and schedule meetings with your Personal Meeting ID (PMI). See the Zoom Support articles, [Using Personal Meeting ID (PMI)](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203276937-Using-Personal-Meeting-ID-PMI-) and [Personal meeting ID (PMI) and personal link](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362843-Personal-meeting-ID-PMI-and-personal-link), for details.

When Zoom creates a meeting using your PMI, it creates a unique meeting ID that you can see in the create meeting response. However, Webhooks events will still show your PMI. You should also use your PMI to pass into endpoints, such as:
* [Create a meeting](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings)
* [Update a meeting](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/PUT/meetings/{meetingId}/status)
* [List meetings](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/GET/users/{userId}/meetings)

## Meeting ID and UUID

* A meeting ID is a system-generated identifier of an instant or scheduled Zoom meeting. It is unique to the created meeting.
* A UUID is specific to the particular instance of a meeting.

If you have a recurring meeting for example, a UUID is generated for each occurrence. While a meeting ID may expire 30 days after the last time it is used, a UUID does not. 

## Double-encoding

When you see a note in the API that asks you to double encode a value, for example, a Meeting UUID that begins with a '/'or contains '//', it means you should encode the data twice in a row using the same encoding scheme. You can use various methods to do this, including free resources such as the [URL encoder site](https://www.urlencoder.org/).

## Time in Zoom API

Zoom API supports the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) date and time format as well as local time. Some APIs only support UTC time. See the format shown below in the API reference doc for the supported format.

```text
yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ   UTC
yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss    Local time
```

For example, if the parameter shows that it accepts the date and time in `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` format, this indicates UTC time.

## Download URL

You can download recordings and other assets from Zoom using the `download_url` (the URL to download the recording) in API responses and event notifications such as webhooks. Zoom dynamically generates the `download_url` for each request.

If a user has authorized and installed your OAuth app that contains recording scopes, use the `download_access_token` or the user's [OAuth access token](/docs/integrations/oauth/)\* to download the file. Set the token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. For example:

```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' https://{{base-domain}}/rec/archive/download/xyz
```

\*For Video SDK use your [Video SDK API JWT](/docs/video-sdk/api-request/).

### Redirects

The `download_url` may also be a redirect. In that case, be sure to follow redirects. For example, use the `curl` `--location` option or another tool like Postman.

For example, you can create a new user or delete a user's meeting recordings.\n\n***Note: In this document, you may see the terms client and app used interchangeably. Both of these terms refer to an app using the Zoom API.***\n\nZoom **must** authenticate each HTTP request made to the Zoom API. Zoom supports **OAuth 2.0**.\n\n## Using OAuth 2.0\n\nZoom uses [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for authentication. This lets applications obtain access to Zoom resources, such as a user's profile information, using the Zoom API.\n\nThe following sections provide an overview on the OAuth protocol. To begin using the OAuth protocol for your app's authentication with Zoom, follow the steps in [OAuth 2.0 for Zoom](/docs/integrations/oauth/).\n\n### OAuth roles\n\nThe OAuth protocol defines four specific roles. These roles are actively involved in the process of authentication with Zoom APIs:\n\n- **Resource Owner** - A user in a Zoom account who can either authorize or decline a **Client** from accessing information related to the user's Zoom account.\n- **Resource Server** - The server that hosts the resource. If your app is integrating with the Zoom API to obtain user-related information, then the Zoom API server is considered the resource server.\n- **Client** - The application that requests access to the user's information. If your app makes access requests to the Zoom API, then your app is considered the Client.\n- **Zoom Authorization Server** - The authorization server issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating and obtaining authorization from the resource owner.\n\n### What is an access token?\n\nAn **access token** is a credential in the form of a string that represents the authorization granted to the app. For example, like an ID card that identifies a person's level of authority or a driver's license that gives a person permission to drive.\n\n### User-authenticated\n\nGenerally, the interaction between a **Client** (your app), a Zoom user, Zoom's authorization server, and the Zoom API follows the flow in the following diagram. This is called the user-authenticated flow as the user has to give access permission to the app.\n\n<Image src=\"/img/1570826762485.png\" alt=\"The Zoom authorization process\" />\n\n1. The **Client** (your app) requests authorization from the Zoom user to access the user's information.\n2. The user authorizes the app and the app receives an **Authorization Grant**.\n3. The app presents the **Authorization Grant** to the **Zoom Authorization Server** to verify that it has received the user's permission to access user information.\n4. The **Zoom Authorization Server** acknowledges that user has permitted the app with requested access and it sends an **Access Token** along with a **Refresh Token** back to the app. The access token must be used as a means of authentication while making API calls to the Zoom API Server.\n5. The app calls the Zoom API to access requested resource by including the **Access Token** in the request as a means of authentication. When an access token expires, it becomes invalid. In this case, the client must use the **Refresh Token** to request another valid access token.\n6. After the Zoom API server authenticates the app, it sends back the **Requested Resource** in the form of a JSON response. If the authentication fails, an error is thrown stating what caused the error.\n\n### Server-to-Server authentication\n\nServer-to-server authentication does not require the end user to give permission to the app to access their information. The following diagram shows this flow.\n\n<Image src=\"/img/s2s-auth-flow.png\" alt=\"The Zoom Server-to-Server authorization flow\" />\n\nThe [Server-to-Server OAuth app type](/docs/internal-apps/) skips the end user authorization step as well as the redirect URL and refresh token.\n\n### OAuth grant types\n\nAn **Authorization Grant** is the authorization assigned to the **Client** by the resource owner. The **grant type** refers to the method the Client uses to request authorization.\n\nZoom supports the standard `authorization_code`, `device_code`, and `refresh_token` [grant types](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use). See [OAuth 2.0 for Zoom](/docs/integrations/oauth/) for details.\n\nZoom also created the `account_credentials` grant type for server-to-server OAuth app types. See [Internal apps (server-to-server) - Use account credentials to get an access token](/docs/internal-apps/#use-account-credentials-to-get-an-access-token) to learn more.\n\n#### Authorization Code\n\nThe following steps provide an overview of the **Authorization Code** grant flow:\n\n1. The **Client** directs the user to the Zoom authorization server. The user will see a dialog box with permission request for access. This process is provisioned by Zoom via the **Authorization URL**. When a user tries to add your app, the user is directed to the Zoom API authorization endpoint. To test it with your app locally, copy the **Testable URL** of your app and open it in a browser. A page similar to the one shown in the image below appears:\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/img/1570827314139.png\"\n  alt=\"An example of the permission request dialog box.\"\n/>\n\n2. The user clicks **Authorize**.\n3. The user is redirected to the app's `redirect_url` along with an Authorization Code in the query string. The URL with the Authorization Code resembles following URL: `https://yourappsredirecturl/?code={theauthorizationcode}`\n4. The **Client** makes a request to Zoom to exchange the Authorization Code for an **access token**.\n\n**Example Node.js request access token with Authorization Code**\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require('request');\n\nvar options = {\n  method: 'POST',\n  url: 'https://zoom.us/oauth/token',\n  qs: {\n    grant_type: 'authorization_code',\n    //The code below is a sample Authorization Code. Replace it with your actual Authorization Code while making requests.\n    code: 'B1234558uQ',\n    //The uri below is a sample redirect_uri. Replace it with your actual redirect_uri while making requests.\n    redirect_uri: 'https://abcd.example.com',\n  },\n  headers: {\n    /**The credential below is a sample base64 encoded credential. Replace it with \"Authorization: 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(your_app_client_id + ':' + your_app_client_secret).toString('base64')\"\n     **/\n    Authorization: 'Basic abcdsdkjfesjfg',\n  },\n};\n\nrequest(options, function (error, response, body) {\n  if (error) throw new Error(error);\n\n  console.log(body);\n});\n```\n\n## Using JWT\n\nA JSON Web Token (JWT) lets you to create tokens that provide secure data transmission using a compact JSON object. JWTs contain a signed payload that helps establish server-to-server authentication. See [JWT.io](http://jwt.io) to learn more.\n\n## API requests\n\n<Alert>\n\n**Global base API URL: `https://api.zoom.us/v2/`**\n\n</Alert>\n\nAll API requests **must** be made over HTTPS. The `https://api.zoom.us/v2/` URL is the default request base URL. This includes the API version, `/v2`, in the path.\n\nThe complete API request URL varies depending on the accessed resource. For example, to [get a user's details](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/GET/users/{userId}) in your app, you **must** make an `GET` request to the [**Get a user**](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/GET/users/{userId}) API at the `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/{userId}` URL, where `{userId}` is the user's ID or email address. If your app is registered in the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us/) as an account-level **OAuth app**, your app **must** have the `user:read:admin` scope in order to use this API.\n\n### Regional base URLs\n\nThe `api_url` in the access token response indicates the region serving that user so you can directly send API requests to that region. Currently we expose the following regions.\n\nRegion Name | Region | API URL\n---         | ---    | ---\nAustralia | AU | `https://api-au.zoom.us`\nCanada | CA | `https://api-ca.zoom.us`\nEuropean Union | EU | `https://api-eu.zoom.us`\nIndia | IN | `https://api-in.zoom.us`\nSaudi Arabia | SA | `https://api-sa.zoom.us`\nSingapore | SG | `https://api-sg.zoom.us`\nUK | UK | `https://api-uk.zoom.us`\nUS | US | `https://api-us.zoom.us`\nVanity account  | N/A | `https://{vanity}.zoom.us`\n\nYou can use the `api_url` to create a regional base URL to send requests. Be sure to also include the version in the path, for example `/v2/`.\n\nFor example, you can use the base URL `https://api-eu.zoom.us/v2/` to send API requests directly to the EU region if it was returned in the `api_url` field. However, regardless of the `api_url` value, you can continue to use the global region at `https://api.zoom.us` all requests.\n\n***The global API URL is the default: `https://api.zoom.us`.***\n\n### Example API requests\n\n**Example Node.js API request with the user ID for Account-level apps**\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require('request');\n\nvar options = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  // A non-existing sample userId is used in the example below.\n  url: 'https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/sjkf1234',\n  headers: {\n    authorization: 'Bearer {yourtokenhere}', // Do not publish or share your token publicly.\n  },\n};\n\nrequest(options, function (error, response, body) {\n  if (error) throw new Error(error);\n\n  console.log(body);\n});\n```\n\n**Example Node.js API request with the user ID for User-level apps**\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require('request');\n\nvar options = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  // Use the `me` keyword for the request below.\n  url: 'https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me',\n  headers: {\n    authorization: 'Bearer {yourtokenhere}', // Do not publish or share your token with anyone.\n  },\n};\n\nrequest(options, function (error, response, body) {\n  if (error) throw new Error(error);\n\n  console.log(body);\n});\n```\n\n### Requests for JWT apps\n\nYou do not need scopes for [JWT apps](/docs/internal-apps/jwt/). Your JWT app will only have access to **your** Zoom account's information. To view a specific user's information, you **must** provide the user's `userId` or email address as the `{userId}` value in the API path. You can also use [the `me` keyword](the-me-keyword) instead of the `userId` value.\n\n### Requests for OAuth apps\n\nTo get information about a user with a user-level OAuth app, the app **must** have the `user:read` scope. While the URL for the request is the same, the behavior of `userId` value is different from an account-level apps. Instead of providing a user's `userId` or email address, you **must** use [the `me` keyword](#the-me-keyword) as the value of the `userId` path parameter. Otherwise, your app will receive an invalid token error.\n\n### Requests for Server-to-Server OAuth apps\n\nServer-to-Server OAuth apps also use scopes. You wouldn't use the `me` keyword with this app type; you must provide a `userId` or email address. See [Server-to-Server authentication](#server-to-server-authentication) for details.\n\n## The me keyword\n\nYou can use the `me` keyword in place of the `userId` and the `accountId` keyword in any supported API call. When you use the `me` keyword, the API call uses the authenticated user's access token.\n\nFor example, to use the API to [update a user's settings](/docs/api/users/#tag/users/PATCH/users/{userId}/settings) as the authenticated user, you would call the API with the `/users/me/settings` path, not the `/users/{userId}/settings` path.\n\n## Shared access permissions\n\nSome users may have permissions to access (create, read, update, or delete) information associated with other users on Zoom accounts. For example, the [Schedule Privilege](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362803-Scheduling-privilege) enables users to assign other users on their account to schedule meetings on their behalf. A user that has been granted this privilege has access to schedule meetings for the other user. A user may also have a [role](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001078646) that grants them access to other user information.\n\nWith shared access permissions, a user can choose whether your app can access the following information:\n\n1. Only information associated with them as the user that added the app (including others involved in that information, for example, a calendar invitation), **or**\n2. Both the information associated with them and the others that user is allowed to access (again, along with the others included in that information, such as a calendar invitation).\n\nItem 2 refers to when a user authorizes your app to use their \"shared access permissions\" after they add or manage your app on their account. In the example above, the user can choose to share access permissions to schedule meetings for another user's account with your app. See [Allowing Apps access to shared access permissions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4413265586189) for details on the end user experience.\n\n### Handling errors for shared access permissions\n\nYour app does not need to do anything different for this access. Zoom handles this via the [Authorization server](/docs/api/using-zoom-apis#oauth-roles).\n\nThe users that added your app can continue using your app to access their associated information without the need to take any action. If your app does not access or change information associated with a user other than the user who added it, then you should not receive additional errors.\n\nYour app will receive an error **if your app attempts to access or change information for a user other than the one who added the app** and when the user who added the app:\n\n- Is not authorized to access or change the other user's information, or\n- Has not authorized your app to use shared access permissions.\n\nIn this case, your app will receive a 403 response with an \"authenticated user has not permitted access to the targeted resource\" error. This will occur after a request to any API, such as:\n\n- `/v2/meetings/{meetingId}/**`\n- `/v2/users/{userId}/**`\n- `/v2/webinars/{webinarId}/**`\n- `/v2/**/recordings/`\n- `/v2/phone/**` (user-level)\n\nCurrently, there is no way for your app to know whether a user has authorized shared access permissions for your app. You may be able to determine whether a user should have shared permissions based on the context. For example, your app lets users schedule meetings. In this case, when your app receives the error, you can point the user to the [Allowing Apps access to shared access permissions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4413265586189) Zoom Help Center article that describes how the user can authorize shared permissions for the app.\n\nOnce the user authorizes your app with shared permissions, the API will return the expected response.\n\n## Apps with high API failure rates\n\nIf any single app has a high error-to-request ratio, Zoom may disable your app. Your apps must handle requests and errors gracefully. If your app was disabled because of a high failure rate or high error-to-request ratio, contact [Support](https://support.zoom.us/) or reach out on the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.zoom.us) for help.\n\n## Email address display rules\n\nZoom displays email addresses for users external to your account only if they meet any of the conditions below:\n\n* **If the participant entered their email address** into the meeting or webinar registration flow, then it will be shown for that specific meeting or webinar.\n* **If the host provided the participant's email to Zoom** in the following ways:\n  - If the participant is on the calendar invitation or event using one of Zoom's calendar integrations (Outlook or Google Calendar).\n  - If the participant has externally authenticated using an authentication system provided by the host.\n  - If the participant email was entered with the \"[Allow authentication exception](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360037117472#h_01F13A9N1FQFNVESC9C21NRHXY)\" option under \"Only authenticated users can join...\"\n  - If the participant's email was entered using the Breakout Rooms assignment feature or \"Allow authentication exception\" to Breakout Rooms feature.\n  - If you import a CSV file for panelists and attendees of a webinar.\n\nFor more information, read the [\"Zoom API email address display rules\" Changelog post](/changelog/platform/zoom-api-email-address-display-rules).\n\n## Understanding Personal Meeting ID (PMI)\n\nYou can start instant meetings and schedule meetings with your Personal Meeting ID (PMI). See the Zoom Support articles, [Using Personal Meeting ID (PMI)](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203276937-Using-Personal-Meeting-ID-PMI-) and [Personal meeting ID (PMI) and personal link](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362843-Personal-meeting-ID-PMI-and-personal-link), for details.\n\nWhen Zoom creates a meeting using your PMI, it creates a unique meeting ID that you can see in the create meeting response. However, Webhooks events will still show your PMI. You should also use your PMI to pass into endpoints, such as:\n* [Create a meeting](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings)\n* [Update a meeting](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/PUT/meetings/{meetingId}/status)\n* [List meetings](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/GET/users/{userId}/meetings)\n\n## Meeting ID and UUID\n\n* A meeting ID is a system-generated identifier of an instant or scheduled Zoom meeting. It is unique to the created meeting.\n* A UUID is specific to the particular instance of a meeting.\n\nIf you have a recurring meeting for example, a UUID is generated for each occurrence. While a meeting ID may expire 30 days after the last time it is used, a UUID does not. \n\n## Double-encoding\n\nWhen you see a note in the API that asks you to double encode a value, for example, a Meeting UUID that begins with a '/'or contains '//', it means you should encode the data twice in a row using the same encoding scheme. You can use various methods to do this, including free resources such as the [URL encoder site](https://www.urlencoder.org/).\n\n## Time in Zoom API\n\nZoom API supports the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) date and time format as well as local time. Some APIs only support UTC time. See the format shown below in the API reference doc for the supported format.\n\n```text\nyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ   UTC\nyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss    Local time\n```\n\nFor example, if the parameter shows that it accepts the date and time in `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` format, this indicates UTC time.\n\n## Download URL\n\nYou can download recordings and other assets from Zoom using the `download_url` (the URL to download the recording) in API responses and event notifications such as webhooks. Zoom dynamically generates the `download_url` for each request.\n\nIf a user has authorized and installed your OAuth app that contains recording scopes, use the `download_access_token` or the user's [OAuth access token](/docs/integrations/oauth/)\\* to download the file. Set the token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. For example:\n\n```shell\ncurl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' https://{{base-domain}}/rec/archive/download/xyz\n```\n\n\\*For Video SDK use your [Video SDK API JWT](/docs/video-sdk/api-request/).\n\n### Redirects\n\nThe `download_url` may also be a redirect. In that case, be sure to follow redirects. For example, use the `curl` `--location` option or another tool like Postman.\n",
