# Meeting API Security Enhancements

On December 20th, 2020, the **Require that all meetings are secured with one security option** security setting was added to all Zoom customers' [**Account Settings**](https://zoom.us/account/setting) tab in the **Security** section. This setting is **automatically enabled and locked** for **single license users**, **Pro accounts with 2 or more licenses**, and **Business accounts with 10 to 100 licenses**. All meetings scheduled by these types of accounts **must** be secured with one of the following security options:

* A [passcode](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832-Zoom-Meeting-and-Webinar-passcodes).
* The [**Waiting Room**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) feature.
* The [**Only authenticated users can join meetings**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4406604615693-Requiring-authentication-to-join-a-meeting-webinar) setting.

If you disable all three settings (for example, `password = null`, `waiting_room = false`, `meeting_authentication = false`) in the Request Body of the [**Create a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings) or [**Update a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/PUT/meetings/{meetingId}/status) API requests, Zoom will **overwrite** the provided values to enable at least one of these settings. In such cases, note the values returned in the [**Create a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings)
API Response Body or use the [**Get a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/GET/meetings/{meetingId}) API to fetch and store accurate information regarding the meeting's applied security settings.

> Note the following when creating and updating meetings scheduled via the [Zoom web portal](https://zoom.us/account) versus the Zoom API:
>
> * Creating meetings via the Zoom web portal synchronizes your scheduler settings.
> * Meetings created via the Zoom API do **not** synchronize your Zoom web portal scheduler settings. Instead, the API **requires** that the user set the meeting's options in the API's Request Body.

The [**Require that all meetings are secured with one security option**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059665892-Requiring-meetings-to-have-one-security-option) setting can only be disabled by **Enterprise**, **API**, **Business (with more than 100 licenses)**, and **Education** users.

## About this document

This document outlines how this requirement impacts the response of your Zoom [**Create a meeting**](#create-a-meeting-api) and [**Update a meeting**](#update-a-meeting-api) API requests in different scenarios. For each of the scenarios outlined below, the following request parameters apply:

* **Waiting Room** &mdash; The value for the `waiting_room` field is either not provided (`null`) or set as `true` or `false`.
* **Passcode** &mdash; The value for the `password` field is either not provided (`null`), set as an empty string (`""`), or a valid value.
* **Only authenticated users can join meetings** &mdash; The value for the `authentication_option` field is either not provided (`null`), set as an empty string (`""`), or a valid value.

## Create a meeting API

|   | Settings | Result |
| - | -------- | ------ |
| **Scenario 1** | The Waiting Room, passcode, and authentication setting are enabled and locked for users in the account. | The Waiting Room, passcode, and authentication setting are enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> In the response, the `waiting_room` and `meeting_authentication` field values are `true`. The `password` and `authentication_option` field values are set to the values provided in the request. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, a valid password is automatically generated by Zoom and is included in the request's response. <br /><br /> If a value for the `authentication_option` field is **not** provided in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. |
| **Scenario 2** | The Waiting Room is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode and authentication setting are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room remains disabled. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `password`, `meeting_authentication`, and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. <br /><br /> If a value is **not** provided for the `password` field and the value of the `meeting_authentication` field is `false`, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. |
| **Scenario 3** | The authentication setting is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room and passcode settings are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The meeting authentication setting remains disabled. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is automatically enabled if you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request. |

        "content": "\n# Meeting API Security Enhancements\n\nOn December 20th, 2020, the **Require that all meetings are secured with one security option** security setting was added to all Zoom customers' [**Account Settings**](https://zoom.us/account/setting) tab in the **Security** section. This setting is **automatically enabled and locked** for **single license users**, **Pro accounts with 2 or more licenses**, and **Business accounts with 10 to 100 licenses**. All meetings scheduled by these types of accounts **must** be secured with one of the following security options:\n\n* A [passcode](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832-Zoom-Meeting-and-Webinar-passcodes).\n* The [**Waiting Room**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) feature.\n* The [**Only authenticated users can join meetings**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4406604615693-Requiring-authentication-to-join-a-meeting-webinar) setting.\n\nIf you disable all three settings (for example, `password = null`, `waiting_room = false`, `meeting_authentication = false`) in the Request Body of the [**Create a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings) or [**Update a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/PUT/meetings/{meetingId}/status) API requests, Zoom will **overwrite** the provided values to enable at least one of these settings. In such cases, note the values returned in the [**Create a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/POST/users/{userId}/meetings)\nAPI Response Body or use the [**Get a meeting**](/docs/api/meetings/#tag/meetings/GET/meetings/{meetingId}) API to fetch and store accurate information regarding the meeting's applied security settings.\n\n> Note the following when creating and updating meetings scheduled via the [Zoom web portal](https://zoom.us/account) versus the Zoom API:\n>\n> * Creating meetings via the Zoom web portal synchronizes your scheduler settings.\n> * Meetings created via the Zoom API do **not** synchronize your Zoom web portal scheduler settings. Instead, the API **requires** that the user set the meeting's options in the API's Request Body.\n\nThe [**Require that all meetings are secured with one security option**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059665892-Requiring-meetings-to-have-one-security-option) setting can only be disabled by **Enterprise**, **API**, **Business (with more than 100 licenses)**, and **Education** users.\n\n## About this document\n\nThis document outlines how this requirement impacts the response of your Zoom [**Create a meeting**](#create-a-meeting-api) and [**Update a meeting**](#update-a-meeting-api) API requests in different scenarios. For each of the scenarios outlined below, the following request parameters apply:\n\n* **Waiting Room** &mdash; The value for the `waiting_room` field is either not provided (`null`) or set as `true` or `false`.\n* **Passcode** &mdash; The value for the `password` field is either not provided (`null`), set as an empty string (`\"\"`), or a valid value.\n* **Only authenticated users can join meetings** &mdash; The value for the `authentication_option` field is either not provided (`null`), set as an empty string (`\"\"`), or a valid value.\n\n## Create a meeting API\n\n|   | Settings | Result |\n| - | -------- | ------ |\n| **Scenario 1** | The Waiting Room, passcode, and authentication setting are enabled and locked for users in the account. | The Waiting Room, passcode, and authentication setting are enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> In the response, the `waiting_room` and `meeting_authentication` field values are `true`. The `password` and `authentication_option` field values are set to the values provided in the request. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, a valid password is automatically generated by Zoom and is included in the request's response. <br /><br /> If a value for the `authentication_option` field is **not** provided in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. |\n| **Scenario 2** | The Waiting Room is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode and authentication setting are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room remains disabled. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `password`, `meeting_authentication`, and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. <br /><br /> If a value is **not** provided for the `password` field and the value of the `meeting_authentication` field is `false`, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. |\n| **Scenario 3** | The authentication setting is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room and passcode settings are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The meeting authentication setting remains disabled. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is automatically enabled if you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request. |\n| **Scenario 4** | The Waiting Room and authentication setting are either enabled or disabled without being locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is disabled and locked. | The passcode remains disabled. <br /><br /> If the values the `waiting_room` and `meeting_authentication` fields are set to `false`, Zoom automatically enables the Waiting Room. |\n| **Scenario 5** | The Waiting Room and passcode settings are disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is either enabled, enabled and locked, or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room and passcode remain disabled. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is enabled. <br /><br /> If a value for the `authentication_option` field is **not** provided in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. |\n| **Scenario 6** | Both the Waiting Room and authentication setting are disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is either enabled, enabled and locked, or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room and authentication setting remain disabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. |\n| **Scenario 7** | Both the passcode and authentication setting are disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is either enabled, enabled and locked, or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> The authentication setting and passcode remain disabled. |\n| **Scenario 8** | The Waiting Room is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode and authentication setting are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The Waiting Room is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `password`, `meeting_authentication`, and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. <br /><br /> If a value is **not** provided for these fields, the meeting will **not** be password protected and will **not** have meeting authentication requirements. |\n| **Scenario 9** | The passcode is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room and authentication setting are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The passcode is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `password`, `meeting_authentication`, and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. <br /><br /> If values for these settings are **not** provided, they will remain disabled. |\n| **Scenario 10** | The authentication setting is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room and passcode settings are either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The authentication setting is enabled. <br /><br /> If a value for the `authentication_option` field is not provided in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room and passcode may be enabled or disabled depending on the values provided in the Request Body. |\n| **Scenario 11** | Both the Waiting Room and passcode settings are enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is either enabled or disabled without a lock. | The Waiting Room and passcode are enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `meeting_authentication` and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. |\n| **Scenario 12** | Both the Waiting Room and authentication setting are enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is either enabled or disabled without a lock. | The Waiting Room and authentication setting are enabled and applied to the meeting. <br /><br /> If a value for the `authentication_option` field is not provided in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, the meeting will **not** have a passcode. |\n| **Scenario 13** | The passcode and authentication setting are both enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is either enabled or disabled without being locked. | The passcode and authentication remain enabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `authentication_option` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is enabled only if the `waiting_room` field's value is set to `true` in the Request Body. |\n| **Scenario 14** | The passcode is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is either enabled or disabled. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is disabled and locked. | The passcode is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is enabled only if the `waiting_room` field's value is set to `true` in the Request Body. <br /><br /> The authentication setting remains disabled and will **not** be applied to the meeting. |\n| **Scenario 15** | The authentication setting is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is either enabled or disabled without being locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is disabled and locked. | The authentication setting is enabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `authentication_option` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is enabled only if the `waiting_room` field's value is set to `true` in the Request Body. <br /><br /> The passcode remains disabled. |\n| **Scenario 16** | The Waiting Room is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is either enabled or disabled. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is disabled and locked. | The Waiting Room is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> A `passcode` is applied only if a valid value is provided for the `password` field in the Request Body. <br /><br /> The authentication setting remains disabled. |\n| **Scenario 17** | The authentication setting is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is either enabled or disabled. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is disabled and locked. | The authentication setting is enabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `authentication_option` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> A passcode is applied only if a valid value is provided for the `password` field in the Request Body. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room remains disabled. |\n| **Scenario 18** | The Waiting Room is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is either enabled or disabled. | The Waiting Room is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> The passcode remains disabled. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `meeting_authentication` and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. |\n| **Scenario 19** | The passcode is enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is disabled and locked. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is either enabled or disabled. | The passcode is enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room remains disabled. <br /><br /> If valid values are provided for the `meeting_authentication` and `authentication_option` fields, the same values are applied to the meeting. |\n| **Scenario 20** | The passcode and authentication setting are enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room is disabled and locked. | The passcode and authentication are enabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `authentication_option` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The Waiting Room remains disabled. |\n| **Scenario 21** | The Waiting Room and authentication setting are enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The passcode is disabled and locked. | The Waiting Room and authentication setting are enabled. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `authentication_option` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a default value and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The passcode will remain disabled. |\n| **Scenario 22** | The Waiting Room and passcode settings are enabled and locked. <br /><br /> The authentication setting is disabled and locked. | The Waiting Room and passcode are enabled for the meeting. <br /><br /> If you do **not** provide a value for the `password` field in the request, Zoom automatically generates a valid password and includes it in the request's response. <br /><br /> The authentication setting remains disabled. |\n| **Scenario 23** | All three settings are either enabled or disabled without a lock. | The settings are applied based on the values provided in the Request Body. <br /><br /> If none of the security options are enabled in the request, Zoom automatically enables the Waiting Room for the meeting. |\n\n## Update a
